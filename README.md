Mosaic UI for WPF is a control library that seeks to provide compartmentalized controls that if needed could be easily extracted from this project and included in your own.

Almost every WPF UI kit contains a way to theme that's custom and unique to their framework, it makes mixing and matching controls sometimes cumbersome. This project is trying to provide enough themeing options that you could use it by itself but not tether all of the controls to it so you could include it, or parts of it in other projects that use other UI libraries.  I'll also be providing basic examples of how to use each control so you've got a copy/paste reference to start from and a working demo app to quickly browse and try out controls.

WPF is a great, mature technology that will be with us for a long time now that's part of .NET Core.  WPF's longevity and potential longevity is one of the strengths of it.  If you're writing a hobby project you want to be around in 10 years, WPF is a great choice.  Credit to the dotnet developer team for bringing it the modern .NET stack.
